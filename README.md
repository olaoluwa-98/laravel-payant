Inspired By unicodeveloper's [laravel-paystack](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/laravel-paystack)

Main functions from Jonathan Itakpe's [payantNG-php](https://github.com/JonathanItakpe/payantNG-php)

> A Laravel 5 Package for working with Payant

## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.4+ or [HHVM](http://hhvm.com) 3.3+, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

To get the latest version of Laravel Payant, simply add the following line to the require block of your `composer.json` file.

```
"olaoluwa-98/laravel-payant": "1.0.*"
```

You'll then need to run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.

Once Laravel Payant is installed, you need to register the service provider. Open up `config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

* `Olaoluwa98\Payant\PayantServiceProvider::class`

Also, register the Facade like so:

```php
'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Payant' => Olaoluwa98\Payant\Facades\Payant::class,
    ...
]
```

## Configuration

You can publish the configuration file using this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Olaoluwa98\Payant\PayantServiceProvider"
```

A configuration-file named `payant.php` with some sensible defaults will be placed in your `config` directory:

```php
<?php

return [

    /**
     * Public Key From Payant Dashboard
     *
     */
    'public_key' => getenv('PAYANT_PUBLIC_KEY'),

    /**
     * Private Key From Payant Dashboard
     *
     */
    'private_key' => getenv('PAYANT_PRIVATE_KEY'),

    /**
     * Whether Payant API URL Is DEMO Or Not
     */
    'isdemo' => getenv('IS_DEMO'),
];
```

## Usage

Open your .env file and add your public key, private key, demo status like so:
You can get them from your [Payant Dashboard](https://payant.ng/settings/developer)

```php
PAYANT_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
PAYANT_PRIVATE_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
IS_DEMO="TRUE" if in demo mode or leave it empty if in live mode
```

Functions are named based on the documentation located [API Documentation](https://developers.payant.ng/overview)
Read the functions in the documentation to know parameters needed for each function

You can use the package in your controller by adding `use Payant;`

```php
$client_data = ['first_name' => 'Emmanuel',
                'last_name' => 'Awotunde',
                'email' => 'awotunde.emmanuel1@gmail.com',
                'phone' => '+2348090579032'];
Payant::addClient($client_data);

//the function above would return the following JSON data if request is successful
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Client created successfully.",
  "data": {
    "company_id": <company_id>,
    "name": "<name>",
    "first_name": "<first_name>",
    "last_name": "<last_name>",
    "email": "<email>",
    "phone": "<phone_no>",
    "website": "<website>",
    "address": "<address>",
    "type": "Customer",
    "settlement_bank": "",
    "account_name": "",
    "account_number": "",
    "status": "1",
    "created_at": "date",
    "updated_at": "date",
    "id": <id_of_client>
  }
}
```
